                                                <p>I explored the principles of descriptive statistics, analyzing datasets to extract valuable information about central tendencies, continuous frequency distributions, and measures of dispersion. I learned to calculate the 5-point summary, Interquartile Range (IQR), and other key summary statistics, enabling me to gain deeper insights into data distributions.
                                                </p><br />
											
											<p>	<h4>Correlation and Covariance Analysis</h4>
                                                
												<p>In this assignment, I studied the concepts of covariance and correlation, crucial measures in understanding the relationship between variables. Through practical exercises, I learned to calculate and interpret these measures, offering valuable insights into patterns and dependencies within the data.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Probability Distributions</h4>
												<p>I delved into various probability distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, and hypergeometric distributions. Through calculations and simulations, I grasped their applications and how they are used in real-world scenarios.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Normal Distribution and Confidence Interval</h4>
												<p>Understanding the normal distribution's properties and characteristics was a significant part of the assignment. I also explored the concept of confidence intervals, a fundamental tool for estimating population parameters from sample data.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Hypothesis Testing</h4>
												<p>I delved into the world of hypothesis testing, learning various techniques such as t-test and z-test. I applied these methods to draw conclusions about population parameters based on sample data, enabling me to make data-driven decisions.
                                                </p><br />

                                                <h4>Data Cleaning and Visualization in Advanced Excel</h4>
                                                
												<p>I explored data cleaning techniques, such as dealing with missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring data consistency. I also learned to create visually appealing charts and graphs in Advanced Excel to present data effectively.
                                                </p><br />
												<h4>Outcomes</h4>
                                                
												    <p>- Developed a strong foundation in descriptive statistics and data analysis techniques, empowering me to draw valuable insights from raw data.
                                                    </p>
													<p>- Gained proficiency in probability distributions, allowing me to model and predict various uncertain events in business scenarios.

                                                    </p>
													<p>- Acquired knowledge of hypothesis testing, enabling me to make statistically sound decisions based on sample data.
                                                    </p>
													<p>- Mastered data cleaning and visualization in Advanced Excel, facilitating effective communication of data findings to diverse stakeholders.


                                                    </p>
