                                                <h4>Programming Fundamentals</h4>
												<p>I began with fundamental programming concepts, learning about variable declaration, conditional statements, and control flow structures. I gained proficiency in generating sequence numbers, managing functions, and working with data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and strings.


                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Functional Programming and Modules</h4>
												<p>I delved into functional programming paradigms, exploring the concepts of filter and map functions. Additionally, I learned to organize code by utilizing modules and packages effectively.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Descriptive Analytics and Visualization</h4>
												<p>I acquired essential skills in descriptive analytics, manipulating data to generate summary statistics and visualizing data through various plotting techniques. This enabled me to gain insights and draw meaningful conclusions from datasets.

                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Regression Models and Model Evaluation</h4>
												<p>I studied regression models, understanding how to build them and assess their performance. I learned to interpret regression model summaries, measure accuracy metrics such as ROC and AUC, and determine optimal cutoff points for binary classification tasks.


                                                
                                                <h4>Decision Tree Classification and Ensemble Learning</h4>
												<p>I explored decision tree classification using Gini impurity, learning how to build decision trees and interpret their results. Additionally, I delved into ensemble learning methods like bagging and boosting to improve model performance.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Cross-Validation and Residual Analysis</h4>
												<p>I studied cross-validation techniques to assess model generalization and prevent overfitting. Moreover, I learned to perform residual analysis and generate residual plots to evaluate model goodness-of-fit.
                                                </p><br />
