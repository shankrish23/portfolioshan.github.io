												<h3>Group Assignment: "Nike" Data Visualization</h3>
                                                <p>For this group assignment, my team and I embarked on a comprehensive data visualization project centered around the iconic brand "Nike." The objective was to showcase the brand's stock performance, Point of Care (POC) data, and other key metrics in a visually engaging manner while weaving a compelling story with the insights.
